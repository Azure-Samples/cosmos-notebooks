Throughput is defined as Request Units/second, or RU/s. \n\nYou can think of RU/s as the currency for throughput, or a rate-based currency. An RU is an abstract unit of compute that abstracts how much resources (CPU, IOPS, memory) are required for each operation. \n\n![RequestUnits](https://cosmosnotebooksdata.blob.core.windows.net/notebookdata/request-units.png)\n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Understanding the benchmark for RU cost of operations"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"In Azure Cosmos DB, we've defined RU as follows:\n\n##### 1 RU = cost to read a 1 KB document\n##### 5 RU = cost to write a 1 KB document\n##### Query = depends on number of documents returned and complexity of query\n\nFor example, let's say a container is provisioned at 400 RU/s, with 1 KB documents. Each second, Azure Cosmos DB can serve 400 reads / second, or 80 writes / second, or any combination of operations that consume up to 400 RU/s. \n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### What happens when you exceed the provisioned RU/s?\n\nThink of RU/s as a rate based currency. Each second, you have a certain RU/s to spend on operations. When you exceed the provisioned RU/s, the service will issue a 429 response along with a ```x-ms-retry-after-ms``` header to the client to indicate the request was throttled. By default, the Cosmos client SDKs handle these 429s and will retry up to 30 seconds or 9 times, whichever occurs first.\n\n<img src=\"https://cosmosnotebooksdata.blob.core.windows.net/notebookdata/RequestUnitRateLimiting.PNG\" alt=\"Explanation of rate limiting\" width=\"50%\"/>\n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### How to provision throughput (RU/s) on a database or container\nThroughput can be provisioned at the database or container level.
